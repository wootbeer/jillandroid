/*
 * Android port note (this file, not upstream): CORE_STARTWORX()/CORE_CLOSEWORX() are the
 * real-mode WORX resident-driver install/shutdown hooks -- already reduced to empty stubs
 * upstream itself (the DOS WORX boundary is fully replaced by HOSTAUDIO.H's host_audio_*
 * calls, see jill/UNKNOWN.c's own header comment) -- nothing left to port beyond the
 * filename. Renamed JVOL.C -> JVOL.c for the same CMake gotcha as jill/GR.c (see that
 * file's own header comment).
